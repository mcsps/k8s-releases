# Release v2.4.12

## Important

- **Please review the [v2.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.4.0) for important updates/ breaking changes.**

* **Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version [[#25117](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25117)]** - Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version. Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes. 

- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup. 
 
- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper. 

- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied. 
 
- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster. 

- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Please refer to the zero downtime upgrades feature to read more about it.

### Known Major Issues

- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]
- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\API Server Request Rate\_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]
- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue. [[27252](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27252)]

## Upgrades and Rollbacks

Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback. Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.

Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.

Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see [the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.

**Important:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected.
