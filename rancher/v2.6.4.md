# Release v2.6.4
# Release v2.6.4

> It is important to review the Install/Upgrade Notes below before upgrading to any Rancher version.

> In Rancher v2.6.4, the cluster-api module has been upgraded from v0.4.4 to v1.0.2 in which the apiVersion of CAPI CRDs are upgraded from `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` to `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`. This has the effect of causing rollbacks from Rancher v2.6.4 to any previous version of Rancher v2.6.x to fail because the previous version the CRDs needed to roll back are no longer available in v1beta1. To avoid this, the Rancher resource cleanup script should be run **before** the restore or rollback is attempted. This script can be found in the [rancherlabs/support-tools repo](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/cleanup-rancher-k8s-resources) and the usage of the script can be found in [the backup-restore operator docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/). See also [#36803](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36803) for more details.

# Features and Enhancements

### New in Rancher

- Kubernetes v1.22 is no longer experimental and is now supported. Kubernetes v1.23 is experimental.
- Kubernetes v1.22 and v1.23 are available as Kubernetes version options when provisioning clusters as well as upgrading imported RKE2/k3s clusters.
- Rancher on IBM Z is now in tech preview.

### New in Cert-Manager
- Rancher now supports cert-manager versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1. We recommend v1.7.x because v 1.6.x will reach end-of-life on March 30, 2022. To read more, see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#4-install-cert-manager).
- When upgrading Rancher and cert-manager, you will need to use [Option B: Reinstalling Rancher and cert-manager](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/upgrades/#option-b-reinstalling-rancher-and-cert-manager) from the Rancher docs.
- There are several versions of cert-manager which, due to their backwards incompatibility, are not recommended for use with Rancher. You can read more about which versions are affected by this issue in the [cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/). As a result, only versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1 are recommended for use at this time.
- For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.5 to 1.6, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.5-1.6/).
- For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.6 to 1.7, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.6-1.7/).

### New in RKE2 - Tech Preview

- UI Enhancements in RKE2 Cluster Provisioning 
 - The UI now provides an option to rotate certificates for RKE2 provisioned clusters, including an option to rotate certificates for an individual component. See Dashboard [#4485](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4485).
 - S3 configuration support has been re-enabled for RKE2 snapshots; this is required for RKE2 provisioning parity with RKE1. See Dashboard [#4551](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4551).
 - When restoring RKE2 cluster etcd snapshots, more restore options are available. See Dashboard [#4539](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4539).
 - “Auto Replace” option support enabled for RKE2 machine pools. See Dashboard [#4449](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4449).
 - Ability to scale down individual nodes for RKE2-provisioned clusters added. See Dashboard [#4446](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4446).
 - Enhanced RKE2 cluster provisioning on Linode. See Dashboard [#3262](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3262).
 - Added user-configurable OS field for vSphere machine pools. See Dashboard [#4859](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4859).
 - \Drain Before Delete\ support for RKE2 machine pools has been added. Note that when editing nodes and enabling the \Drain Before Delete\ option, the existing control plane nodes and worker nodes are deleted and new nodes are created. It should be noted that for etcd nodes, the same behavior does not apply. See [#35274](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35274) and Dashboard [#4448](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4448).
 - Health checks were added to support self-healing RKE2 machine pools. See [#35275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35275).
- Bug Fixes
 - RKE2 clusters can now be provisioned using the AWS cloud provider with Kubernetes v1.22. See [#35618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35618).
 - Clusters can be created from an RKE2 template as non-admin user. [#34844](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34844).
-	Known Issues in Windows
 - Experimental Support for RKE2 Provisioning tech preview for Windows will only work on v1.22 and up of RKE2. End users should not use v1.21.x of RKE2 for any RKE2 cluster that will have Windows worker nodes. This is due to an [upstream Calico bug](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) that was not backported to the minor version of Calico (3.19.x) that is present in v1.21.x of RKE2. See [#131](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131).
 - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed.
 - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.
 - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).
-	Other Known Issues
 - RKE2 node driver cluster gets stuck in provisioning state after an upgrade to v2.6.4 and rollback to v2.6.3. See [#36859](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36859).
 - RKE2 node driver cluster has its nodes redeployed when upgrading Rancher from v2.6.3 to v2.6.4. See [#36627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36627).
 - RKE2 node driver cluster gets stuck in provisioning state in Kubernetes v1.23.x. See [#36939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36939).
 - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cillium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/faq/networking/cni-providers/#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275)
 - `cluster state` changes to `Provisioning` when a worker node is deleted in an RKE2 cluster. See [#36689](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36689).
 - `cluster state` changes to `Provisioning` when a snapshot is taken in an RKE2 cluster. See [#36504](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36504).

### UI Enhancements in Fleet

- Added a Bundles tab to the GitRepo detail view. See Dashboard [#4794](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4794).
- Added a Detail view for the Fleet Bundle resource. See Dashboard [#4793](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4793).
- Fleet controller logs are now viewable on cluster dashboard. See Dashboard [#3668](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3668).
- In the Continuous Delivery dashboard, badge colors have been updated to feature counts that convey health status information. See Dashboard [#5232](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5232).
- On the Git Repos detail page, error notifications were added to the Conditions tab. See Dashboard [#5218](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5218).
- Added a new dashboard view to Fleet at the top of the navigation list; this is the default page that the user will land on. See Dashboard [#5048](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5048).
- In the Git Repos detail page, a warning icon now displays when the GitRepo does not apply to any clusters. See Dashboard [#4929](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4929).

### Other UI Enhancements

- Nvidia GPU Reservation can be edited on the workloads page. See Dashboard [#5005](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5005).
- The UI now uses a nested structure to determine whether to display global or cluster-scoped resources in the role creation forms, and which API group should be auto-populated when a resource is selected. See Dashboard [#4888](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4888).
- An edit and detail UI has been added for NetworkPolicies. See Dashboard [#4729](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4729).
- On the namespace detail page, a new tab was added that shows the workloads. See Dashboard [#5115](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5115).
- In Apps and Marketplace, existing charts have been updated with annotations such that users will better understand what occurs in their mixed Linux/Windows workload cluster if they deploy a chart. See Dashboard [#5137](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5137).
- If a custom consent banner is enabled, after logging into Rancher, a user must now accept or deny consent. By default, consent is required to use Rancher, but can be configured to be optional. See Dashboard [#4719](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4719).
- Improvements added to the Rollback Diff view: ability to switch between the side-by-side and inline diff and the ability to collapse (or hide) the fields that are non-standard. See Dashboard [#4636](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4636).
- Users can now create a ConfigMap at the project scope. See Dashboard [#4571](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4571).

### Security Enhancements

- New `restricted-noroot` PSP created to prevent pods from running as a privileged user. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/pod-security-policies/), [#35191](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35191) and security advisory [GHSA-hwm2-4ph6-w6m5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-hwm2-4ph6-w6m5).
- CIS Hardening Guide updated for Rancher 2.6. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/security/hardening-guides/) and [#35735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35735).

### Other New Features

- Users can now provision node driver clusters from an air gapped cluster configured to use a proxy for outbound connections. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/) and [#28411](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28411).
- The ancher/install-docker\ script now supports the Linux distributions `SLES / OpenSUSE / RHEL / Rocky Linux` for the Docker versions `20.10.8 / 20.10.9 / 20.10.10`. See [#34615](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34615).
- Users can now configure the `Readiness Check` and `Liveness Check` of `coredns-autoscaler`. See [#24939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24939).

### Behavior Changes

- If you provide your own security group for an EC2 instance, Rancher will not modify it; therefore, you must set the security group to [allow the necessary ports for Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/ports/#rancher-aws-ec2-security-group) to provision the instance. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/node-pools/ec2/ec2-node-template-config/#security-group) and [#3832](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3832).

### Rancher
- Fixed error in which standard users received an error when creating a cluster from the `Edit as YAML` and `Edit as a Form` buttons. See [#35868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35868).
- If the `rancher-node` security group is used, the existing security group is not modified, as expected. See [#24337](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24337).
- For namespaces created inside projects via `kubectl`, when a resource limit exceeds the remaining amount in the project, Rancher no longer assigns an all-restrictive quota limit. Instead, a zero limit is set for the exceeding resource only. See [#35647](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35647).
- When deploying a cluster on v1.22, monitoring installation works as expected. See [#35571](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35571).
- Fixed an issue in which Calico probes failed on Windows nodes. See [#36910](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36910).
- Enabling `Cluster Monitoring` through the API or the UI will set the same memory. See [#25103](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25103).
- When creating a RKE cluster with the Rancher CLI, the values from a config file are not applied. See [#25416](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25416).
- The `Container Default Resource Limits` are now applied when a new namespace is created in a project via `kubectl` (bypassing the UI). See [#27750](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27750).
- Deploying clusters using the Azure node driver causes `Pod Predicate NodeAffinity failed error` on `default-http-backend` pod. See [#29882](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29882).
- Hairpin rules are not added when using IPVS with a cloud provider enabled. See [#30363](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30363).
- Cluster namespaces remain after deleting a cluster. See [#31546](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31546).
- Upgrading Kubernetes version on downstream clusters causes a memory consumption increase. See [#31640](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31640).
- Configuring Keycloak (SAML) authentication fails with decoding error `Unknown error: SAML: cannot initialize saml SP, cannot decode IDP Metadata content from the config`. See [#33709](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33709).
- Intermittent health check failure causes unreachable downstream clusters. See [#34819](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34819).
- Backups taking longer than 5 minutes will cause Rancher to start a new backup and delete the one that is currently running, generating a backup loop. See [#34890](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34890).
- K3s Docker image should now be used in the Dockerfile instead of downloading the K3s binary. See [#35101](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35101).
- When Logging v1 and v2 are both installed, the v1 `fluentd` pods get stuck with the `crashlooping` error. See [#35125](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35125).
- Syslog output can now be sent through UDP in Logging v2. See [#35197](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35197).
- The `cattle-node-cleanup` job will be deleted after it times out. See [#35334](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35334).
- If a new namespace does not fit the Project quota limits, a `zero quota` limit will be created only for the new namespace's resources. See [#35647](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35647).
- When upgrading a RKE cluster, the status is seen as active even though the add-on's are still being updated. See [#35750](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35750).
- `rancher-webhook` certificate renewal workaround updated. See [#35860](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35860).

- Importing KEv2 clusters with the Rancher client have their config correctly rewritten. See [#36128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36128).
- The `rancher-monitoring` ports for `node-exporter` and `push-proxy-clients` are no longer opened on the host. See [#36140](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36140).
- DNS redirect iptables rules are now correctly created by `istio-cni`. See [#36159](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36159).
- When using Fleet to apply the configuration, it will only apply the final configMap entry. See [#36242](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36242).
- When creating a cluster, RKE will panic if `rotate_encryption_key` is enabled and `secrets_encryption_config` disabled. See [#36333](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36333).
### Security
- Role bindings are now created with `owner refs` referring to the `global role bindings` which caused their creation. See [#934](https://github.com/rancherlabs/rancher-security/issues/934).
- When creating cluster role bindings and role bindings, several parts of rancher assumed that the subject (i.e. the user/group that the role is being bound to) was a user. This caused errors (and an inability to create the binding) when a group was bound to these roles instead. See [#974](https://github.com/rancherlabs/rancher-security/issues/974).
- Error syncing handler `grb-cluster-sync: RoleBinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io`. See [#975](https://github.com/rancherlabs/rancher-security/issues/975).

# Install/Upgrade Notes

> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)
> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows.

### Upgrade Requirements

- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)
- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).
- **Kubernetes version:**
 - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.
 - When using Kubernetes v1.21 with Windows Server 20H2 Standard Core, the patch \2019-08 Servicing Stack Update for Windows Server\ must be installed on the node. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).
- **CNI requirements:**
 - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).
 - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).
 - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).
- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**
 - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).
 - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).
- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).
- **Requirements for Docker installs:**
 - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).
 - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).
 - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).

### Rancher Behavior Changes

- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.
- **Users must manually remove legacy services.** When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted. See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).
- **Charts from library and helm3-library catalogs can no longer be launched.** Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.
- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)
- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).
- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).
- **The Fleet agent in the local cluster now lives in `cattle-fleet-local-system`.** Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \Fleet is managing Fleet\. The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).
- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).
- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).
- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.
- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.
- **New steps for rolling back Rancher.** The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.
- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters.** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).
- **New procedure to set up Azure cloud provider for RKE2.** For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.
- **Machines vs Kube Nodes.** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.
- **Rancher's External IP Webhook chart no longer supported in v1.22.** In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).
- **Increased memory limit for Legacy Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).
- **Increased memory limit for Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).

# Versions

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.

Please review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.

### Images
- rancher/rancher:v2.6.4

### Tools
- CLI - [v2.6.4](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.4)
- RKE - [v1.3.8](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.8)

### Kubernetes Versions
- v1.23.4 (Experimental)
- v1.22.7 (Default)
- v1.21.10
- v1.20.15
- v1.19.16

### Rancher Helm Chart Versions

Starting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).

# Other Notes

### Feature Flags
Feature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:

Feature Flag | Default Value | Description
---|---|---
`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.
`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.
`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \Continuous Delivery\ feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.
`rke2` | `true` | 	We have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.
`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.
`token-hashing` | `false` | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.

### Experimental Features

RancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).


### Legacy Features

Legacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.

When you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.

The deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.

The following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:

* Logging
* CIS Scans
* Istio 1.5
* Pipelines

The following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:

* Monitoring V1

### Known Major Issues

- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**
 - **RKE:**
 - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).
 - Actions that can’t be performed by a cluster member, `Download KubeConfig` and `Take Snapshot`, are being shown as available on RKE1 clusters in a Rancher setup. See [#35828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35828).
 - On the Cluster Management page, snapshot-related actions such as create/restore and `rotate certificate` are not available for a standard user in RKE1. See Dashboard [#5011](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5011).
 - Dual stack is [not supported](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#ipv6-networking) for RKE1 Windows clusters, specifically v1.23.4 with dual stack networking becoming [GA in upstream Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). See Windows [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).
 - **RKE2 - Tech Preview:** There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.
 - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).
 - When provisioning using a RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).
 - **RKE2 - Windows:**
 - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace. See [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405).
 - Windows clusters do not yet support upgrading RKE2 versions. See Windows [#76](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/76).
 - **AKS:**
 - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).
 - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).
 - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.
 - **GKE:**
 - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).
 - **AWS:**
 - In an HA Rancher server on Kubernetes v1.20, ingresses on AWS EC2 node driver clusters do not go through and result in a `failed calling webhook` error. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754#issuecomment-995566492). See [#35754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754).
 - On RHEL8.4 SELinux in AWS AMI, Kubernetes v1.22 fails to provision on AWS. As Rancher will not install RPMs on the nodes, users may work around this issue either by using AMI with this package already installed, or by installing AMI via cloud-init. Users will encounter this issue on upgrade to v1.22 as well. When upgrading to 1.22, users must manually upgrade/install the rancher-selinux package on all the nodes in the cluster, then upgrade the Kubernetes version. See [#36509](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36509).
- **Infrastructures:**
 - **vSphere:**
 - The vSphere CSI Driver does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to unsupported v1beta1 CRD APIs. Support will be added in a later release, but in the meantime users with the `CSIMigrationvSphere` feature enabled should not upgrade to Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33848](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33848).
 - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).
- **Harvester:**
 - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.
 - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).
- **Cluster Tools:**
 - **Fleet:**
 - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).
 - **Hardened clusters:** 
 - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.
 - **Rancher Backup:**
 - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.
 - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).
 - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).
 - When performing a backup/restore using Helm, the command will fail if Let's Encrypt is used. See [#37060](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37060).
 - **Monitoring:**
 - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).
 - Monitoring fails to upgrade when CRD is in a failed state. To work around this issue, use Helm to install the `rancher-monitoring` chart into the cluster directly, rather than using the Rancher UI. In order to set nodeSelector or tolerations to the `rancher-monitoring-crd` chart, you need to install the `rancher-monitoring-crd` and `rancher-monitoring` chart by using the Helm command via command line. Rancher UI will add support soon. See [#35744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35744).
 - **Logging:**
 - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).
 - **Istio Versions:**
 - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.
 - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.
 - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. Everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).
 - In Istio v1.10.4, Kubernetes IP service is set to default IP, which does not work for all environments. To work around this issue, install Istio version 100.1.0+up1.11.4 in the downstream cluster, and installation will complete successfully. Note that the new install will not include the Kiali CRD. See [#35339](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35339).
 - As part of the upgrade to Istio 1.11.4, Kiali was upgraded to 1.41 which removed the CRD installation. If you upgraded from a previous version of `rancher-istio`, you will need to manually delete the `rancher-kiali-server-crd` found on the installed apps page, since it is no longer in use after the upgrade completes. See [#35686](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35686).
 - A `failed calling webhook \validation.istio.io\` error will occur in air gapped environments if the `istiod-istio-system` `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` exists, and you attempt a fresh install of Istio 1.11.x and higher. To work around this issue, run the command `kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration istiod-istio-system` and attempt your install again. See [#35742](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35742#issuecomment-994801502).
 - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).
 - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).
 - **Legacy Monitoring:**
 - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).
 - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:
 - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart
 - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use
 - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).
 - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).
 - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).
- **Docker Installations:**
 - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).
 - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\ and \Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\. Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).
 - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).
- **Login to Rancher using Active Directory with TLS:** 
 - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an Active Directory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Go v1.15. See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).
 - The error received is \Error creating SSL connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \Network Error\: x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\
 - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` as an environment variable to Rancher server container.
- **Rancher UI:**
 - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See Dashboard [#5336](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5336).
 - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).
- **Legacy UI:**
 - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).
