### Bug or Regression

- Fixes an upgrade issue with Helm. People upgrading from cert-manager v1.2 should now be able to upgrade with no error. ([#3886](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3886), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Fixes a regression that was introduced in v1.3. Before v1.3, a CertificateRequest that would fail would have the condition `Ready=False` added to it. After v1.3, the `Ready=False` was not set anymore due to the addition of the [Approval API](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificaterequest/#approval). ([#3892](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3892), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
