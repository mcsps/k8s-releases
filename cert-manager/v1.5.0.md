# Release v1.5.0
# Release notes for release-1.5

cert-manager 1.5 is the first release to support Kubernetes 1.22.

Note: in cert-manager 1.7, the API versions `v1alpha2`, `v1alpha3` and `v1beta1` will be removed in cert-manager 1.7. Keep in mind that you will have to change all your YAML manifests that use a deprecated API version to use `cert-manager.io/v1` instead, and re-apply them before cert-manager 1.7.

- Fire event when a CertificateSigningRequest has not yet been approved, so will skip processing until it is. ([#4229](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4229), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

- Adds an explicit 10 second timeout when checking HTTP01 challenges for reachability ([#4318](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4318), [@SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish))
- Cloudflare: Refactored DNS01 challenge to use API for finding the nearest Zone (fixing potential DNS-Issues) ([#4147](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4147), [@thiscantbeserious](https://github.com/thiscantbeserious))
- Fix a bug where failed Certificate Requests were not retried ([#4130](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4130), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Fix check for self-signed certificates in EncodeX509Chain which broke certs whose subject DN matched their issuer's subject DN ([#4237](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4237), [@SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish))
- Fix handling of chains which don't have a root in ParseSingleCertificateChain, and improve handling in situations where that function is passed a single certificate. ([#4261](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4261), [@SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish))
- Fixed a bug in the \gateway shim\ controller that was causing the cert-manager controller to crash
 with a nil pointer exception when using the annotation \cert-manager.io/issuer\ on a Gateway that
 had an empty `tls` block or with `certificateRef` left empty. ([#4293](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4293), [@maelvls](https://github.com/maelvls))
- Fixed a goroutine leak that was causing the controller's memory usage to grow with time ([#4233](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4233), [@maelvls](https://github.com/maelvls))

 with a large number of certificates. ([#4231](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4231), [@maelvls](https://github.com/maelvls))
- Set correct exit codes on ctrl+c event & process defer calls on error ([#4230](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4230), [@inteon](https://github.com/inteon))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Adds conformance E2E suite for CertificateSigningRequests ([#4101](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4101), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- Allows to configure labels on cert-manager webhook service via a Helm value. ([#4260](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4260), [@mozz-lx](https://github.com/mozz-lx))
- Allows to configure which annotations get copied from Certificate to CertificateRequest. Annotations with keys prefixed with `kubectl.kubernetes.io/`, `fluxcd.io`, `argocd.argoproj.io` are now excluded by default. ([#4251](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4251), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Minor cleanup of make targets, to prepare for more use of make in cert-manager ([#4109](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4109), [@SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish))
- Pre-v1 cert-manager resource requests now must be converted to v1 in order to be validated/mutated by admission webhooks. (Default cert-manager validating and mutating webhook configurations ensure the resource requests are being converted) ([#4172](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4172), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Reduce binary sizes by adding \-w\ as ldflag ([#4181](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4181), [@inteon](https://github.com/inteon))

- Remove v1beta1 as an accepted AdmissionReviewVersion. cert-manager now only supports v1, available since Kubernetes v1.16 ([#4254](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4254), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- Remove v1beta1 as an accepted ConversionReviewVersion. cert-manager now only supports v1, available since Kubernetes v1.16 ([#4253](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4253), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- The controllers now exit more cleanly (eg. the Leader Election Lease is freed properly on shutdown) ([#4243](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4243), [@inteon](https://github.com/inteon))
