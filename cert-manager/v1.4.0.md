# Changelog since v1.3.1

## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- The CA issuer now attempts to store the root CA instead of the issuing CA into the `ca.crt` field for issued certificates; this is a change of behavior. All of the information which was previously available is still available: the intermediate should appear as part of the chain in `tls.crt`. ([#3865](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3865), [@erikgb](https://github.com/erikgb))
- RunAsNonRoot is now enabled by default in the securityContext values. If you're using custom containers with the chart that run as root, you will need to set this back to false. ([#4036](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4036), [@wallrj](https://github.com/wallrj))

- Adds an option for a Kubernetes CertificateSigningRequest controller to implement the CA Issuer. ([#4064](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4064), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- RunAsNonRoot is now enabled by default in the securityContext values. If you're using custom containers with the chart that run as root, you will need to set this back to false. ([#4036](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4036), [@wallrj](https://github.com/wallrj))
- The Vault issuer now constructs a certificate chain after signing, and populates the CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate if available. ([#3982](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3982), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

- Change Venafi Issuer to populate CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate that was returned from signing. ([#3983](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3983), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- The webhook can now be configured to be accessible from outside of the cluster. ([#3876](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3876), [@anton-johansson](https://github.com/anton-johansson))
- Update Akamai issuer to use Open Edgegrid EdgeDNS v2 API ([#4007](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4007), [@edglynes](https://github.com/edglynes))

- Fixes a bug where the default cert renewal duration (30d) was clashing with the duration of certs issued by Vault PKI. All Certificates are now renewed 2/3 through the duration unless custom renew period specified by setting spec.renewBefore on the Certificate. ([#4092](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4092), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Fixes an issue where an ACME `Certificate` with a long name (52 characters or more) does not get renewed due to non-unique `Order` names being generated. ([#3866](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3866), [@jandersen-plaid](https://github.com/jandersen-plaid))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Cert-manager controller now uses ConfigMapsLeasesResourceLock for leader election. ([#4016](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4016), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))

These APIs will be removed in cert-manager v1.6 ([#4021](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4021), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- Optimistic locking messages (the object has been modified) are now logged at the Info level instead of the Error level, as cert-manager controllers will automatically retry until successful. ([#3794](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3794), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
