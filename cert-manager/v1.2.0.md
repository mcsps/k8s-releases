# Release v1.2.0
## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE ⚠️ The minimum supported Kubernetes version is now v1.16.0** as of cert-manager `v1.2.0`. Users still running Kubernetes `v1.15` or below should upgrade to a supported version before installing cert-manager or use cert-manager `v1.1`.
- The `User-Agent` request header sent by cert-manager has changed to reflect the ownership transfer to the CNCF — see ([#3515](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3515), [@meyskens](https://github.com/meyskens))
- The `--renew-before-expiration-duration` flag of the cert-manager controller-manager has been deprecated. Please set the `Certificate.Spec.RenewBefore` field instead. This flag will be removed in the next release.
- Certificates issued by the Vault issuer have changed — the root CA instead of the issuing CA is now stored in `ca.crt` — see ([#3433](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3433), [@sorah](https://github.com/sorah))
