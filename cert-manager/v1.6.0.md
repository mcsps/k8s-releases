# Release v1.6.0
# Changelog since v1.5.0

## Breaking Changes (You **MUST** read this before you upgrade!)

⚠️ Following their deprecation in version 1.5, the cert-manager APIVersions `v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1` are no longer served.

This means if your deployment manifests contain any of these API versions, you will not be able to deploy them after upgrading. Our new `cmctl` utility or old `kubectl cert-manager` plugin can [convert](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/kubectl-plugin/#convert) old manifests to `v1` for you.

⚠️ JKS Keystores now have a minimum password length of 6 characters, as an unintended side effect of upgrading [keystore-go](https://github.com/pavel-v-chernykh/keystore-go) from v2 to v4. If you are using a shorter password, certificates will fail to renew, and the only observable error will be in the cert-manager logs. We are discussing the best remediation for a future v1.6.1 release.
