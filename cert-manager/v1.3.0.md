# Release v1.3.0
## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

#### Venafi Cloud Issuer

This release updates the [Venafi Cloud Issuer][] to use `OutagePREDICT` instead of `DevOpsACCELERATE`.
The only impact to Venafi Cloud users is the change in zone syntax.
The zone is now `<Application Name>\<Issuing Template Alias>`
(e.g. `My Application\My CIT`).

[Venafi Cloud Issuer]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/venafi/

#### cert-manager controller

The `--renew-before-expiration-duration` flag has been removed from the cert-manager controller, having been deprecated in the previous release.

#### cert-manager CRDs

`CertificateRequests` are now immutable - the `spec` and `metadata.annotations` fields cannot be changed after creation. They were always designed to be immutable but this behavior is now *enforced* by the cert-manager webhook.
