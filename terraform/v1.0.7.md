# Release v1.0.7
## 1.0.7 (September 15, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

* core: Remove check for computed attributes which is no longer valid with optional structural attributes ([#29563](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29563))
* core: Prevent object types with optional attributes from being instantiated as concrete values, which can lead to failures in type comparison ([#29559](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29559))
* core: Empty containers in the configuration were not planned correctly when used with optional structural attributes ([#29580](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29580))
