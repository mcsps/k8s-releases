# Release v1.0.8
## 1.0.8 (September 29, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

* cli: Check `required_version` as early as possibly during `init` so that version incompatibility can be reported before errors about new syntax ([#29665](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29665))
* core: Don't plan to remove orphaned resource instances in refresh-only plans ([#29640](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29640))
