ENHANCEMENTS:
* command/init: Cache Terraform Registry metadata responses when handling multiple references to the same module. ([#23727](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23727))
* command/state-mv: Detect and remove references elsewhere in the state to the source address in a `terraform state mv` operation. This does not affect any current operations but will cause the resulting state snapshot to be different than before, and a future version of Terraform may make use of this additional precision. ([#23791](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23791))

BUG FIXES:

* command/init: Fix an issue with via an update to go-getter where modules would fail to download from the registry ([#23792](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23792))
* command/init: use backend config from state when `-backend=false` is used during `init`. ([#23802](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23802))
* core: Do not evaluate unused config values, which may not be valid during destroy ([#23717](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23717))
* core: Better error handling for an odd \should never happen\ situation regarding the restoration of a deposed instance during a `create_before_destroy` replace action. While this does not yet fix the situation (it can still happen), it now has a specialized error message to hopefully help gather some more information about the root cause in future reports. ([#23718](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23718))
* core: Prevent insertion of default providers when resources are removed from the config. ([#23696](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23696))
* core: Detect and handle dependencies implied by references in a `connection` block directly within a `resource` block. ([#23663](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23663))
* communicator/ssh: Fix deadlock when SSH agent forwarding fails. ([#23661](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23661))
