# Release v0.15.2
## 0.15.2 (May 05, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: Both now support a new planning option `-replace=...` which takes the address of a resource instance already tracked in the state and forces Terraform to upgrade either an update or no-op plan for that instance into a eplace\ (either destroy-then-create or create-then-destroy depending on configuration), to allow replacing a degraded object with a new object of the same configuration in a single action and preview the effect of that before applying it.
* `terraform apply`: Now has a `-destroy` option for symmetry with `terraform plan -destroy`, which makes `terraform destroy` effectively an alias for `terraform apply -destroy`. This change is only for consistency between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`; there are no current plans to deprecate `terraform destroy`. ([#28489](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28489))
* core: Update HCL to allow better planning of dynamic blocks ([#28424](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28424))
* core: Unmark values when planning data sources ([#28539](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28539))

BUG FIXES:

* command/format: Fix various issues with nested-type attribute formatting ([#28600](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28600))
* core: Fix JSON plan output to add sensitivity data for provider-specified sensitive attribute values ([#28523](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28523))
* cli: Fix missing \forces replacement\ UI for attribute changes which are marked as sensitive by the provider ([#28583](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28583))
* cli: Fix crash when rendering diagnostic caused by missing trailing quote ([#28598](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28598))
* functions: Fix crash when calling `setproduct` with one or more empty collections ([#28607](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28607))
