# Release v1.1.8
## 1.1.8 (April 07, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* cli: Fix missing identifying attributes (e.g. \id\, \name\) when displaying plan diffs with nested objects. ([#30685](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30685))
* functions: Fix error when `sum()` function is called with a collection of string-encoded numbers, such as `sum([\1\, \2\, \3\])`. ([#30684](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30684))
* When rendering a diff, Terraform now quotes the name of any object attribute whose string representation is not a valid identifier. ([#30766](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30766))
* Terraform will no longer crash in the `terraform apply` phase if an error occurs during backend configuration. ([#30780](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/30780))
