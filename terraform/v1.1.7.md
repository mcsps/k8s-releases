# Release v1.1.7
## 1.1.7 (March 02, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform show -json`: Improve performance for deeply-nested object values. The previous implementation was accidentally quadratic, which could result in very long execution time for generating JSON plans, and timeouts on Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise. ([#30561](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30561))
* cloud: Update go-slug for terraform.tfstate exclusion to prevent a user from getting an error
 after migrating state to TFC.
