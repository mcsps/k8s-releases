# Release v1.6.1
## 1.6.1 (October 10, 2023)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* backend/s3: The `skip_requesting_account_id` argument supports AWS API implementations that do not have the IAM, STS, or metadata API. ([#34002](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34002))

BUG FIXES:
* config: Using sensitive values as one or both of the results of a conditional expression will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
* config: Conditional expression returning refined-non-null result will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
* cli: Reverted back to previous behavior of ignoring signing key expiration for provider installation, since it's the provider registry's responsibility to verify key validity at publication time. [GH-34004]
* cli: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is now preserved again when fetching modules from git source addresses. [GH-34045]
* cloud: The `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable works with the `cloud` block again; it can specify a workspace when none is configured, or select an active workspace when the config specifies `tags`. [GH-34012]
* backend/s3: S3, DynamoDB, IAM, and STS endpoint parameters will no longer fail validation if the parsed scheme or hostname is empty. ([#34017](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34017))
* backend/s3: Providing a key alias to the `kms_key_id` argument will no longer fail validation. ([#33993](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33993))
