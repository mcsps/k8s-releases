# Release v1.1.3
## 1.1.3 (January 06, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform init`: Will now remove from [the dependency lock file](https://www.terraform.io/language/files/dependency-lock) entries for providers not used in the current configuration. Previously it would leave formerly-used providers behind in the lock file, leading to \missing or corrupted provider plugins\ errors when other commands verified the consistency of the installed plugins against the locked plugins. ([#30192](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30192))
* config: Fix panic when encountering an invalid provider block within a module ([#30095](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30095))
* config: Fix cycle error when the index of a module containing move statements is changed ([#30232](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30232))
* config: Fix inconsistent ordering with nested move operations ([#30253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30253))
* config: Fix `moved` block refactoring to include nested modules ([#30233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30233))
* functions: Redact sensitive values from function call error messages ([#30067](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30067))
* `terraform show`: Disable plan state lineage checks, ensuring that we can show plan files which were generated against non-default state files ([#30205](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30205))
