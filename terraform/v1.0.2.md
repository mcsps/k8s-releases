# Release v1.0.2
## 1.0.2 (July 07, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform show`: Fix crash when rendering JSON plan with sensitive values in state ([#29049](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29049))
* config: The `floor` and `ceil` functions no longer lower the precision of arguments to what would fit inside a 64-bit float, instead preserving precision in a similar way as most other arithmetic functions. ([#29110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29110))
* config: The `flatten` function was incorrectly treating null values of an unknown type as if they were unknown values. Now it will treat them the same as any other non-list/non-tuple value, flattening them down into the result as-is. ([#29110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29110))
