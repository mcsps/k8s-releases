BUG FIXES:

* Prevent crash while serializing the plan for an empty destroy operation ([#32207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32207))
* Allow a destroy plan to refresh instances while taking into account that some may no longer exist ([#32208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32208))
* Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Prevent file uploads from creating unneeded temporary files when the payload size is known ([#32206](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32206))
* Nested attributes marked sensitive by schema no longer reveal sub-attributes in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
* Nested attributes now more consistently display when they become unknown or null values in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
* Sensitive values are now always displayed as `(sensitive value)` instead of sometimes as `(sensitive)` [GH32004]
