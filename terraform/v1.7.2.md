# Release v1.7.2
## 1.7.2 (January 31, 2024)

BUG FIXES:

* backend/s3: No longer returns error when IAM user or role does not have access to the default workspace prefix `env:`. ([#34511](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34511))
* cloud: When triggering a run, the .terraform/modules directory was being excluded from the configuration upload causing Terraform Cloud to try (and sometimes fail) to re-download the modules. ([#34543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34543))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform fmt`: Terraform mock data files (`.tfmock.hcl`) will now be included when executing the format command. ([#34580](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34580))
* Add additional diagnostics when a generated provider block that fails schema validation requires explicit configuration. ([#34595](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34595))
