# Release v1.3.6
## 1.3.6 (November 30, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* Terraform could crash if an orphaned resource instance was deleted externally and had condition checks in the configuration ([#32246](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32246))
* Module output changes were being removed and re-added to the stored plan, impacting performance with large numbers of outputs ([#32307](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32307))
