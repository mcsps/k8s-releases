# Release v0.14.3
## 0.14.3 (December 17, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform output`: Now supports a new aw\ mode, activated by the `-raw` option, for printing out the raw string representation of a particular output value. ([#27212](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27212))

 Only primitive-typed values have a string representation, so this formatting mode is not compatible with complex types. The `-json` mode is still available as a general way to get a machine-readable representation of an output value of any type.
 
* config: `for_each` now allows maps whose _element values_ are sensitive, as long as the element keys and the map itself are not sensitive. ([#27247](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27247))

BUG FIXES:

* config: Fix `anytrue` and `alltrue` functions when called with values which are not known until apply. ([#27240](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27240))
* config: Fix `sum` function when called with values which are not known until apply. Also allows `sum` to cope with numbers too large to represent in float64, along with correctly handling errors around infinite values. ([#27249](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27249))
* config: Fixed panic when referencing sensitive values in resource `count` expressions ([#27238](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27238))
* config: Fix incorrect attributes in diagnostics when validating objects ([#27010](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27010))
* core: Prevent unexpected updates during plan when multiple sensitive values are involved ([#27318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27318))
* dependencies: Fix several small bugs related to the use of `sensitive` values with expressions and functions.
* lang: Fix panic when calling `coalescelist` with a `null` argument ([#26988](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26988))
* `terraform apply`: `-refresh=false` was skipped when running apply directly ([#27233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27233))
* `terraform init`: setting `-get-plugins` to `false` will now cause a warning, as this flag has been a no-op since 0.13.0 and usage is better served through using `provider_installation` blocks ([#27092](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27092))
* `terraform init` and other commands which interact with the dependency lock file: These will now generate a normal error message if the lock file is incorrectly a directory, rather than crashing as before. ([#27250](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27250))
