# Release v1.0.3
## 1.0.3 (July 21, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS

* `terraform plan`: The JSON logs (`-json` option) will now include `resource_drift`, showing changes detected outside of Terraform during the refresh step. ([#29072](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29072))
* core: The automatic provider installer will now accept providers that are recorded in their registry as using provider protocol version 6. ([#29153](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29153))
* backend/etcdv3: New argument `max_request_bytes` allows larger requests and for the client, to match the server request limit. ([#28078](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28078))

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform plan`: Will no longer panic when trying to render null maps. ([#29207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29207))
* backend/pg: Prevent the creation of multiple workspaces with the same name. ([#29157](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29157))
* backend/oss: STS auth is now supported. ([#29167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29167))
