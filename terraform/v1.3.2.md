# Release v1.3.2
## 1.3.2 (October 06, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a crash caused by Terraform incorrectly re-registering output value preconditions during the apply phase (rather than just reusing the already-planned checks from the plan phase). ([#31890](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31890))
* Prevent errors when the provider reports that a deposed instance no longer exists ([#31902](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31902))
* Using `ignore_changes = all` could cause persistent diffs with legacy providers ([#31914](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31914))
* Fix cycles when resource dependencies cross over between independent provider configurations ([#31917](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31917))
* Improve handling of missing resource instances during `import` ([#31878](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31878))
