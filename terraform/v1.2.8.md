# Release v1.2.8
## 1.2.8 (August 24, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* config: The `flatten` function will no longer panic if given a null value that has been explicitly converted to or implicitly inferred as having a list, set, or tuple type. Previously Terraform would panic in such a situation because it tried to \flatten\ the contents of the null value into the result, which is impossible. ([#31675](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31675))
* config: The `tolist`, `toset`, and `tomap` functions, and various automatic conversions that include similar logic, will no longer panic when asked to infer an element type that is convertable from both a tuple type and a list type whose element type is not yet known. ([#31675](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31675))
