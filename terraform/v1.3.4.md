# Release v1.3.4
## 1.3.4 (November 02, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* Fix invalid refresh-only plan caused by data sources being deferred to apply ([#32111](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32111))
* Optimize the handling of condition checks during apply to prevent performance regressions with large numbers of instances ([#32123](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32123))
* Output preconditions should not be evaluated during destroy ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
* Fix crash from `console` when outputs contain preconditions ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
* Destroy with no state would still attempt to evaluate some values ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
* Prevent unnecessary evaluation and planning of resources during the pre-destroy refresh ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
* AzureRM Backend: support for generic OIDC authentication via the `oidc_token` and `oidc_token_file_path` properties ([#31966](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31966))
* Input and Module Variables: Convert variable types before attempting to apply default values. ([#32027](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32027))
* When installing remote module packages delivered in tar format, Terraform now limits the tar header block size to 1MiB to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted module packages. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))
* Terraform will now reject excessively-complex regular expression patterns passed to the `regex`, `regexall`, and `replace` functions, to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted patterns. This change should not affect any reasonable patterns intended for practical use. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))
* Terraform on Windows now rejects invalid environment variables whose values contain the NUL character when propagating environment variables to a child process such as a provider plugin. Previously Terraform would incorrectly treat that character as a separator between two separate environment variables. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))
