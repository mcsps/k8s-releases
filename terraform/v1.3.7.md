# Release v1.3.7
## 1.3.7 (January 04, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* Fix exact version constraint parsing for modules using prerelease versions ([#32377](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32377))
* Prevent panic when a provider returns a null block value during refresh which is used as configuration via `ignore_changes` ([#32428](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32428))
