# Release v1.5.4
## 1.5.4 (July 26, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* `check` blocks: Fixes crash when nested data sources are within configuration targeted by the terraform import command. ([#33578](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33578))
* `check` blocks: Check blocks now operate in line with other checkable objects by also executing during import operations. ([#33578](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33578))
