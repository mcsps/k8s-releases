# Release v1.3.1
## 1.3.1 (September 28, 2022)

NOTE:
* On `darwin/amd64` and `darwin/arm64` architectures, `terraform` binaries are now built with CGO enabled. This should not have any user-facing impact, except in cases where the pure Go DNS resolver causes problems on recent versions of macOS: using CGO may mitigate these issues. Please see the upstream bug https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52839 for more details.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a crash when using objects with optional attributes and default values in collections, most visible with nested modules. ([#31847](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31847))
* Prevent cycles in some situations where a provider depends on resources in the configuration which are participating in planned changes. ([#31857](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31857))
* Fixed an error when attempting to destroy a configuration where resources do not exist in the state. ([#31858](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31858))
* Data sources which cannot be read during will no longer prevent the state from being serialized. ([#31871](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31871))
* Fixed a crash which occured when a resource with a precondition and/or a postcondition appeared inside a module with two or more instances. ([#31860](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31860))
