# Release v1.3.8
## 1.3.8 (February 09, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a rare bug causing inaccurate `before_sensitive` / `after_sensitive` annotations in JSON plan output for deeply nested structures. This was only observed in the wild on the rancher/rancher2 provider, and resulted in glitched display in Terraform Cloud's structured plan log view. ([#32543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32543))
* A variable only referenced by an output precondition error_message may be missing during evaluation ([#32464](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32464))
* Removing a NestingSingle block from configuration results in an invalid plan ([#32463](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32463))
* Null module outputs could be dropped, causing evaluation errors when referring to those module attributes ([#32583](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32583))
* Fix terraform crash when applying defaults into a collection with dynamic type constraint. ([#32454](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32454))
* Updated to newer github.com/mitchellh/cli version, in turn bringing in updates for several indirect dependencies with known security issues. ([#32609](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32609))
* Fix case where the first plan to use a new remote state could be applied twice, corrupting the state ([#32614](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32614))
