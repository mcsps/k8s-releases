# Release v0.14.7
## 0.14.7 (February 17, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* cli: Emit an \already installed\ event when a provider is found already installed ([#27722](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27722))
* provisioner/remote-exec: Can now run in a mode that expects the remote system to be running Windows and excuting commands using the Windows command interpreter, rather than a Unix-style shell. Specify the `target_platform` as `\windows\` in the `connection` block. ([#26865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26865))

BUG FIXES:

* cli: Fix `show -json` not outputting the full module tree when some child modules have no resources ([#27352](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27352))
* cli: Fix excessively slow rendering of very large multi-line string outputs ([#27746](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27746))
* cli: Fix missing provider requirements in JSON plan when specified using `required_providers` instead of provider config ([#27697](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27697))
