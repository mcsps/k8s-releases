# Release v1.27.0
## Significant changes

cloud-provider-openstack does **not** publish images to docker hub starting from release 1.27.0. Starting from 1.27.0 the images will be available only in registry.k8s.io/provider-os.

New images will be:
```
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/cinder-csi-plugin:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/manila-csi-plugin:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/magnum-auto-healer:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/k8s-keystone-auth:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/barbican-kms-plugin:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/octavia-ingress-controller:[release]
registry.k8s.io/provider-os/openstack-cloud-controller-manager:[release]
```

All images available in registry.k8s.io can be seen in https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/registry.k8s.io/images/k8s-staging-provider-os/images.yaml. Some of the old releases are backported to registry.k8s.io.
